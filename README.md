# StockPrices

This project retrieves live company stock information and prices from FinnHub, and displays them in a table view cell. Users may tap any of the table view cells to view more information about the company and the actual stock price. SwiftUI is avoided throughout the project in order to make the app compatible with older versions of iOS. UIKit is used instead.
